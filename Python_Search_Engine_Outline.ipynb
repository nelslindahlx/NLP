        "\n",
        "This Google Colab notebook demonstrates how to create and use a fact-based knowledge graph search engine. The search engine indexes text files in a specified directory, extracts entities and relationships using spaCy, and builds a knowledge graph using NetworkX. The search engine then allows querying based on entities and returns relevant documents.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Steps:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Install Necessary Libraries**:\n",
        "   - Install `spacy` and `networkx` packages.\n",
        "   - Download the spaCy model `en_core_web_sm`.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Import Libraries**:\n",
        "   - Import required libraries: `os`, `spacy`, `networkx`, and `defaultdict` from `collections`.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Define the Search Engine Class**:\n",
        "   - Create the `FactBasedKnowledgeGraphSearchEngine` class with methods to initialize the engine, crawl the directory for text files, extract entities and relationships, index documents, and search for queries.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Prepare Text Files**:\n",
        "   - Use Colab's file upload widget to upload text files.\n",
        "   - Save the uploaded files into a directory named `text_files`.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Initialize the Search Engine**:\n",
        "   - Initialize an instance of the search engine with the `text_files` directory.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Search for a Query**:\n",
        "   - Define a search query.\n",
        "   - Perform the search using the search engine instance.\n",
        "   - Print the search results.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Detailed Breakdown:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Install Necessary Libraries**:\n",
        "   - Install the required Python packages (`spacy` and `networkx`) and download the spaCy model for English language processing.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Import Libraries**:\n",
        "   - Import the necessary modules for file operations, natural language processing, graph operations, and default dictionary handling.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Define the Search Engine Class**:\n",
        "   - **Initialization (`__init__`)**: Initializes the search engine with a directory path, a NetworkX graph, a documents dictionary, and a spaCy NLP model. Calls the `_crawl_directory` method to index documents.\n",
        "   - **Crawling Directory (`_crawl_directory`)**: Reads all text files in the specified directory, extracts content, and calls `_index_document` to index them.\n",
        "   - **Extracting Entities and Relationships (`_extract_entities_and_relationships`)**: Uses spaCy to extract named entities and relationships (subject-verb-object) from the document content.\n",
        "   - **Indexing Document (`_index_document`)**: Adds entities and relationships to the knowledge graph, ensuring nodes and edges are added efficiently.\n",
        "   - **Searching (`search`)**: Processes the search query to extract entities using spaCy, scores documents based on the presence of query entities in the knowledge graph, and returns a list of relevant document filenames sorted by relevance.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Prepare Text Files**:\n",
        "   - Use the `files.upload()` method to upload text files directly into the Colab environment.\n",
        "   - Move the uploaded files to a directory named `text_files`.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Initialize the Search Engine**:\n",
        "   - Create an instance of the `FactBasedKnowledgeGraphSearchEngine` with the `text_files` directory as input.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Search for a Query**:\n",
        "   - Define a search query string.\n",
        "   - Use the `search` method of the search engine instance to perform the search.\n",
        "   - Print the filenames of the documents that match the query.\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook guides you through setting up and using a fact-based knowledge graph search engine step by step, ensuring a clear understanding of each part of the implementation."
